## Prerequisites
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) (v24+)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) (v2.0+)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [API Token](https://data.cityofnewyork.us)

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository

```bash
   git clone git@gitlab.socs.uoguelph.ca:cis3760w26/forest/311-complaint-patterns-and-response-times.git
   cd 311-complaint-patterns-and-response-times
```

2. Setup API token and .env
```
1. Register for a API token at https://data.cityofnewyork.us
2. Copy the root `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your token and database info (for local dev)
```

3. Build and start all services
```bash
   docker compose up --build -d
```

4. View logs (if running detached)
```bash
   docker compose logs -f
```

5. Stop all services
```bash
   docker compose down
```
   > To also remove volumes (wipes database data):
```bash
   docker compose down -v
```

6. Create your branch before making any changes (see Branching below)

## Branching Strategy

All branch names must follow this pattern:
```
<type>/<short-description>
```

### Allowed Types

| Type      | Purpose                                   | Targets |
| :-------- | :---------------------------------------- | :------ |
| hotfix/   | urgent fixes for deployment issues        | main    |
| release/  | release preparation                       | main    |
| feature/  | new features or enhancements              | main    |

## Merge Requests

### Before Opening an MR
- [ ] branch name follows the naming convention
- [ ] all commits follow the commit message format
- [ ] code is tested locally and passes all checks
- [ ] no `.env`, secrets, or large binary files committed (max 25 MB)
- [ ] pipeline passes (lint, tests, build)

### MR Title
Follow the same format as commit messages:
```
feat(auth): add Auth login support
fix(api): resolve timeout on large payloads
```

### MR Description
Use the provided MR template which includes:
- what changed and why
- how to test it
- screenshots (for UI changes)
- related issue or reference

### Review Process
- at least **1 approval** required before merging
- the MR author should **not merge their own MR**
- address all review comments before merging
- resolve all pipeline failures before requesting review


## Code Style

All code must pass linting and formatting checks before a merge request can be approved. These checks run automatically in CI, so fix any failures before requesting a review.

### JavaScript / TypeScript — ESLint + Prettier

Applies to all `.ts`, `.tsx`, `.js`, `.jsx` files.

```bash
# check for lint errors
npm run lint

# auto fix lint errors
npm run lint:fix

# format with Prettier
npm run format

# check formatting without changing files (used in CI)
npm run format:check
```

Config files: `eslint.config.js`, `.prettierrc`

**TypeScript**
- No unused variables or imports 
    - prefix with `_` to intentionally ignore: `_unusedParam`
- Avoid `any` type 
    - use proper types or `unknown` instead (warning)
- All TypeScript recommended rules apply

**React**
- No need to import React in scope 
    - `react/react-in-jsx-scope` is off
- No PropTypes required 
    - TypeScript types are used instead
- React Hooks must follow the [Rules of Hooks](https://react.dev/reference/rules/rules-of-hooks) 
- Hook dependency arrays must be complete 
    - missing deps are a warning

---

### Python — Black

```bash
# format all Python files
black .

# check without making changes (used in CI)
black --check .
```

Config file: `pyproject.toml`

Key rules:
- Max line length: 88 characters
- One import per line

---

### Java — Checkstyle

```bash
# run Checkstyle on main source
./gradlew checkstyleMain

# run Checkstyle on tests too
./gradlew checkstyleTest

# run all checks together
./gradlew check
```

Config file: `config/checkstyle/checkstyle.xml`

---

### General Rules (All Languages)

- **No commented-out code** in final commits 
    - delete it
- **No debug statements** left in code:
    - JavaScript: no `console.log()`, `console.debug()`
    - Python: no `print()` used for debugging
    - Java: no `System.out.println()` used for debugging
- **No hardcoded credentials, URLs, or environment-specific values**
    - use `.env` or config files
- **One responsibility per function** 
    - keep functions small and focused
- **Meaningful names** 
    - variables, functions, and classes should describe what they do

---

### CI Enforcement

All of the following must pass in the pipeline before an MR can be merged:

| Check | Language | Command |
| :---- | :------- | :------ |
| ESLint | JavaScript / TypeScript | `npm run lint` |
| Prettier | JavaScript / TypeScript | `npm run format:check` |
| Black | Python | `black --check .` |
| Checkstyle | Java | `./gradlew checkstyleMain` |

> If CI fails on a style check, fix it locally and push again.

## Testing

All new features must include tests. Tests must pass in CI before an MR can be merged.

---

### Running Tests Inside Docker

Make sure your containers are running before executing any tests:
```bash
# via make
make up

# via docker compose
docker compose up -d
```

---

### Java — JUnit (backend)
```bash
# run all Java tests via make
make test-backend

# run with coverage report
docker compose exec backend ./gradlew test jacocoTestReport
```

Coverage report output: `build/reports/jacoco/test/html/index.html`

---

### Python — Pytest (python)
```bash
# run all Python tests via make
make test-ingestor

# run all Python tests via docker compose
docker compose exec ingestor pytest

# run with coverage report
docker compose exec ingestor pytest --cov=. --cov-report=term-missing

# run a specific test file
docker compose exec ingestor pytest tests/test_complaints.py
```

---

### Frontend — Vitest + MSW (frontend)
```bash
# run all frontend tests via make
make test-frontend

# run all frontend tests via docker compose
docker compose exec frontend npm test

# run in watch mode during development
docker compose exec frontend npm run test:watch

# run with coverage report
docker compose exec frontend npm run test:coverage
```

MSW: is used to intercept and mock API calls during tests 
Note: do not make real API calls in tests

```tsx
// example — mock an API call with MSW
server.use(
  http.get("/api/complaints", () => {
    return HttpResponse.json({ data: mockComplaints });
  })
);
```

---

### Run All Tests
```bash
# run all tests via make
make test

# run all tests via docker compose
docker compose exec backend ./gradlew test & \
docker compose exec ingestor pytest & \
docker compose exec frontend npm test
```

---

### Coverage Requirements

| Layer | Framework | Minimum Coverage |
| :---- | :-------- | :--------------- |
| Java backend | JUnit + JaCoCo | 80% |
| Python | Pytest + Coverage | 80% |
| Frontend | Vitest | 80% |

> CI will fail if coverage drops below 80% in any layer.

---

### General Rules

- All new features must include tests
- Mock only at the boundary (API layer, DB layer)
- Test files must live next to the code they test

## Makefile

Type make to get a full list of options

## Complete Workflow Example

Start to finish.

**4. Make your changes, then run linting**
```bash
# via make
make lint

# via docker compose

## JS / TS
docker compose exec frontend npm run lint:fix

## java
docker compose exec backend ./gradlew checkstyleMain

```

**7. Push your branch**
```bash
git push origin feature/complaints-filter-by-date
```

**8. Open a Merge Request on GitLab**
- Title: `feat(complaints): add date range filter to complaints view`
- Target branch: `main` (auto-set by branch rule)
- Fill in the MR description template
- Assign a reviewer

**9. Address review comments, push fixes**

git commit -m "fix(complaints): correct date range boundary logic"
git push origin feature/complaints-filter-by-date
```

**10. MR is approved and merged by reviewer**
